Keys Pressed: `ssh dtanjuaquio@ieng.ucsd.edu<enter>`

Explanation: The keys I pressed were simply typing in the log-in and entering it.

**Step 5**

Keys Pressed: `git clo <tab> <control> v <enter>`

Explanation: I typed the beginning of the git clone command and took a small shortcut by autofilling with `<tab>`. I then used `<control> v` to paste in the github link that I had copied, and I used `<enter>` to finalize the command.
