Keys Pressed: `ssh dtanjuaquio@ieng.ucsd.edu<enter>`

Explanation: The keys I pressed were simply typing in the log-in and entering it.

**Step 5**

Keys Pressed: `git clo <tab> <command> v <enter>`

Explanation: I typed the beginning of the git clone command and took a small shortcut by autofilling with `<tab>`. I then used `<command> v` to paste in the github link that I had copied, and I used `<enter>` to finalize the command.

**Step 6**

Keys Pressed: `cd lab7 <enter>, <command> v <enter>, <command> v <enter>`

Explanation: I changed the current directory to be the cloned fork. I then (copied and) pasted `javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *.java` and `java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore ...` to run the tests.
